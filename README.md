# Boot project
1) navigate to the project folder
2) 'npm run start'


# Comments
I am new to css-styling, which leaves much to be desired on the front-end aspect of this project.

I had to learn about API fetching in order to complete the task. This went surprisingly well.


## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm test`

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
